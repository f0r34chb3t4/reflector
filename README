The reflector is a tool which reflects against an attacker's host the attacker's traffic. It is able to simulate two non-existent hosts: 'victim' and 'relayer', at both the Ethernet and IP levels. Whenever an attacker sends a packet to victim, the packet is intercepted by the reflector application and re-sent as a packet from relayer to the attacker's host. The reply that is sent by the attacker's host to relayer is then sent back as a packet from victim (in reply to the original packet) to the attacker's host.

The program can be compiled using gcc, using libpcap and libnet libraries:
% gcc -Wall reflector.c -o reflector -lpcap -lnet

The application can be invoked with the following syntax:
# reflector --victim-ip [IP Addr] --victim-ethernet [Ethernet Addr] \
            --relayer-ip [IP Addr] --relayer-ethernet [Ethernet Addr]

A non-default interface can be specified using the --interface command-line option.

E.g.:
# reflector --victim-ip 192.168.1.11 --victim-ethernet 00:0A:0B:0C:11:37 \
            --relayer-ip 192.168.1.9 --relayer-ethernet 00:0A:06:1B:AB:B0
